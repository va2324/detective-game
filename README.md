DETECTIVE GAME

Purpose: Welcome to the Detective Game! You will be playing as Detective Sam Holmes, 
the great-great-great-great grandson of the esteemed detective Sherlock Holmes. 
Your task is to solve a series of 3 murders. For each murder, look around the crime scene 
for clues and determine the identities of the killers.  

Controls:
You can move the detective sprite using the arrow keys on the computer keyboard.
UP ARROW - moves the detective upward
DOWN ARROW - moves the detective downward
RIGHT ARROW - moves the detective rightward
LEFT ARROW - moves the detective leftward

Once you hit the "Start Game" button on the opening screen, you will be placed in the first crime scene. 
In each crime scene, you must interact with the body first to gain all necessary information before beginning the case. 
Once you begin, you must look around the crime scene for clues in the form of other sprites. 
When you touch the detective to another sprite, it will trigger a Message Dialog with instructions or clues. 
Follow the instructions and clues to find the killers and solve the cases. 
Good luck, detective. 

Special Note #1: In Case #1 & Case #3, there will be instances where you will have to access clues by 
entering a passcode of some sort as input. These clues have been set up using the Scanner class to accept user input. 
For these clues, you will have to find a passcode somewhere in the crime scene. Then, once you touch the clue sprite, 
you will be prompted to insert the passcode in the code terminal and hit the "Enter" key to input the code. 
If the code is correct, you can then access the clue.

Special Note #2: In Case #2, there will be witnesses who will give their testimonies regarding the murder. You must approach 
each witness and listen to all of their testimonies before interacting with any clues.
